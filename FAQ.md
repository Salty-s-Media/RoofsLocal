# FAQ

## Why do I need to enter my HubSpot Key?
It is not a must, but if you would like for leads to come into your own hubspot account as soon as we get them, Roofs Local needs your Hubspot key to do that. Don't worry, if you follow the directions in the tutorial video on the dashboard, the permissions will be set so that Roofs Local can only create new contacts, it cannot read any data in your Hubspot account such as contacts or companies. If you do not have a Hubspot or have not added your key yet, you can always view your available leads in the Roofs Local dashboard. You will also receive email and text notifications whenever we get a new lead that matches your zip codes.

## How/When will I be charged for leads?
Contractors are charged once a day at 5AM EST for all the leads received for that contractor's zip code that day. The current price per lead is 250 USD, so if Roofs Local sends you 3 leads throughout the day, you will be charged 750 USD the next morning. We use Stripe for secure and reliable payment and will charge the card you submitted on account registration.
